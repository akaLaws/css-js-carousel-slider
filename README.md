# css-js-carousel-slider
A generic image carousel slider with "previous" and "next" buttons, keyboard events and ransitions. 
Contains a heading text, an paragraph text and call to action button for each slide. 

## Usefulness
The carousel slider is a pretty common element on websites. It's a relevant mini project to practice CSS and JS.
This example also uses JS to change a CSS variable. 

When clicking or using arrows or the corresponding letters for navigation the images and text content slides left or right.
